  1 & %
  Indicates that both a new nonce (\texttt{TDataSrc\_(767:640)}) and
  an new cipherkey (\texttt{TDataSrc\_(639:384)}) have been applied at
  the data input and the next incoming data block will be a header
  block (i.e., associated data). \\
  % 
  2 & %
  Indicates that both a new nonce (\texttt{TDataSrc\_(767:640)}) and
  an new cipherkey (\texttt{TDataSrc\_(639:384)}) have been applied at
  the data input and the next incoming data block will be a payload
  block. \\ \midrule
  % 
  3 & %
  Indicates that a new AD block is applied and the next input block
  will also be an AD block. \\
  %
  4 & %
  Indicates that a new AD block is applied and the next input block
  will be a payload block (i.e., plaintext or ciphertext). \\
  %
  5 & %
  Indicates that a new AD block is applied and next the authentication
  tag should be computed (i.e., no data can be obtained from the
  source as the NORX architecture will be busy with computing the
  tag). \\ \midrule
  %
  6 & %
  Indicates that a new plaintext block is applied and that the next
  input block will also be a plaintext block. \\
  %
  7 & %
  Indicates that a new plaintext block is applied and that the next
  input block will be a trailer block. \\
  %
  8 & %
  Indicates that a new plaintext block is applied and that next the
  authentication tag should be computed. \\ \midrule
  %
  9 & %
  Indicates that a new ciphertext block is applied and that the next
  input block will also be a ciphertext block. \\
  %
  10 & %
  Indicates that a new ciphertext block is applied and that the next
  input block will be a trailer block. \\
  %
  11 & %
  Indicates that a new ciphertext block is applied and that next the
  authentication tag should be computed. \\ \midrule
  %
  12 & %
  Indicates that a new trailer block is applied and that the next
  input block is another trailer block. \\
  %
  13 & %
  Indicates that a new trailer block is applied and that next that
  authentication tag should be computed. \\
